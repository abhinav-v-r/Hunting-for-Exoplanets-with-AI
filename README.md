## üåå Project Overview  

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to automatically identify exoplanets ‚Äî planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system ‚Äî using real datasets from NASA‚Äôs Kepler and TESS missions.  

The system combines two approaches:  
1. Machine Learning (Random Forest) ‚Äì trained on tabular data containing orbital and stellar parameters.  
2. Deep Learning (1D Convolutional Neural Network) ‚Äì trained on light curve data (flux variations over time) fetched via the *Lightkurve* library.  

By detecting characteristic dips in star brightness (transits), the model can accurately predict whether a given observation corresponds to a true exoplanet or a false positive.

## üöÄ Key Features  

- Uses open-source datasets from NASA Exoplanet Archive  
- Automated data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline  
- Random Forest for feature-based classification  
- 1D CNN for time-series (light curve) analysis  
- Visualization of confirmed vs. false positive signals  
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix plots

## üß† How It Works  

1. Dataset Collection:  
   - Downloaded confirmed and candidate exoplanet data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.  
   - Extracted key features like koi_period, koi_depth, and koi_disposition.  

2. Light Curve Processing:  
   - Used Lightkurve to fetch real telescope data.  
   - Cleaned, normalized, and phase-folded light curves.  

3. Model Training:  
   - Random Forest for tabular data classification.  
   - CNN for detecting periodic brightness dips in light curves.  

4. Evaluation:  
   - Compared predictions, plotted confusion matrices, and visualized example curves.

## ü§ñ AI Tool Usage Declaration  

AI tools (specifically ChatGPT ‚Äì GPT-5) were used to assist in drafting project documentation, structuring the development workflow, and creating explanation text.  
All code implementation, model design, and data analysis were performed manually by the project developer.
